Developing low carbon strategies for businesses
Globally, we are currently emitting 51 billion tonnes of carbon per annum. To meet the challenging target of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius) compared to pre-industrial levels, we need to make changes that reduce our carbon emissions immediately. The concept of low carbon development has its roots in the UNFCCC, which was adopted in Rio in 1992. In the context of this convention, low-carbon development is now generally expressed using the term low-emission development strategies (LEDS - also known as low-carbon development strategies or low-carbon growth plans).

CBAM (Cross Border Adjustment Mechanism)
The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is an EU legislation introduced in a transitional state in October 2023. As of October 1, 2023, Regulation 2023/956 introduced the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), intending to reduce carbon emissions, put a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods imported into the EU and encourage a cleaner industrial production through a methodology for calculating embedded emissions according to the Paris Agreement and the EU Fit for 55 packages.

What Our Clients Say
 
Previous Slide◀Next Slide▶
Galebreaker Agri
Keith Hardie Special Projects Director
“Thanks to the Environment Company team carrying out a Business Energy Efficiency Assessment, we identified several ways we could further improve our energy efficiency. Environment Company’s findings identified that, by making their recommended changes, we could achieve annual financial savings of up to £18,872 and 62.81 tonnes of CO2e. They then helped us prioritise the required changes, identify and access the best available funding opportunities, and supported our grant application processes. As a result, and with the minimum of disruption, we have improved our working environment considerably and reduced our energy bills. Environment Company will continue to support us with meeting our energy efficiency targets and the implementation of our low carbon strategy, and I am happy to recommend them to other businesses wishing to develop a low carbon strategy and reduce their own energy costs.”
